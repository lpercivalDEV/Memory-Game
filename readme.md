## Memory Game
This game was my first project in the coding bootcamp. I am still proud of the execution and the UI design.

# The Game
User should pair hidden patterns in a limited number of attempts before the game is over. There are three different levels of difficulty.

# Technologies
The single page game is built on JavaScript and CSS.  

# Deployed App
The deployed version may be found at http://noonkay.github.io/Memory-Game/
If the loading time of the images is slow on github pages, try playing locally.
